# A.X 4.0: Foundation Model Specialized in Korean, Optimized for Enterprise Applications

[**üá∞üá∑ View Korean README**](README.md)

SK Telecom released **A.X 4.0** (pronounced "A dot X"), a large language model (LLM) optimized for Korean-language understanding and enterprise deployment, on April 30, 2025. Built on the open-source [Qwen2.5](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen25-66e81a666513e518adb90d9e) model, A.X 4.0 has been further trained with large-scale Korean datasets to deliver outstanding performance in real-world business environments.

## What Sets A.X 4.0 Apart?

- **Superior Korean Proficiency**: Achieved a score of 78.3 on [KMMLU](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HAERAE-HUB/KMMLU), the leading benchmark for Korean-language evaluation and a Korean-specific adaptation of MMLU, outperforming GPT-4o (72.5).
- **Deep Cultural Understanding**: Scored 83.5 on [CLIcK](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EunsuKim/CLIcK), a benchmark for Korean cultural and contextual comprehension, surpassing GPT-4o (80.2).
- **Efficient Token Usage**: A.X 4.0 uses approximately 33% fewer tokens than GPT-4o for the same Korean input, enabling more cost-effective and efficient processing.
- **Long Context Handling**: Supports up to 131,072 tokens, allowing comprehension of lengthy documents and conversations.
- **Domain Adaptability**: Enhanced capabilities for technical domains such as coding and manufacturing.
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Offered in both a 72B-parameter standard model and a 7B lightweight version, with on-premises installation supported for data-sensitive enterprises.

## Key Technologies

### Korean-Optimized Tokenizer

A.X 4.0 uses a tokenizer designed to capture the linguistic nuances of Korean. Internal tests show it is 33.3% more token-efficient than GPT-4o for the same Korean sentence.

Benefits in real-world application:

- Handling \~1.5x more Korean content under the same token budget
- Up to 34% cost savings in token-based billing
- Advantageous in token-based pricing or time-sensitive environment

In the enterprise deployment environment that usually treats long-form tasks like summarization and RAG, token-efficient model contributes to save management cost.

### High-Quality Korean Training Data

A.X 4.0 is trained with:

- **Large-scale, high-quality Korean corpora**: High-quality Web data, professional books, technical publications, synthetic data
- **Domain-balanced datasets**: Curated for a wide range of enterprise scenarios
- **Balanced language mix**: 42% Korean, 51% English, 7% other languages and code

This allows the model to grasp subtle expressions and context in Korean with high fidelity.

### Efficient Training Process

The training pipeline includes:

- **Tokenizer Aligning**: Replaced original tokenizer with Korean-optimized version
- **Continued Pre-Training (CPT)**: Improved Korean comprehension and overall¬†language understanding  with large-scale Korean corpora
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Enhanced accuracy in responding to various instructions or questions using task-specific high-quality Korean datasets
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Further tuned using human preference data from users' feedback

This approach enables efficient resource use and domain-focused performance improvements by intensively utilizing Korean data.
